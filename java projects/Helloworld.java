 * 
 * Notes 
 * *********************************************************************************************************************************
 * 
 * For Java Everythin is Inside a Class. 
 * 
 *e.g Public Class Hello World { Every class has a name and we named this a class called Hellow World }
 * 
 * Also inside of classes we have methods.
 * 
 * e.g PubliceStaticVoidMain (String [] args){ 
 * 
 * System.out.printlin("Hello there!") <------------This is a Statemet which is also inclued  inside the 'main method.
 * 
 * } 
 * 
 * // String x = new String("Hello"); //property
    //class - contains everything - has members.
    //methods - Do something
    //statements - Telling the computer t0 do something
    //properties - store Something
    //arguments - what you pass or call is to a method
    //paramenter - when we def a method we give it a paramenter : or variables to store atguments 
    //access modifier (public) - who can use and not use would be private.
    //static - no intance of a class is needed 
    //object - instance of a class
    // (string [] args) this are known as arguments...=This helps to make our programs a little more dynamic.

public class Helloworld {  // This is a class and this class name is called Hello World.


    public static void main(String[] args) {  // Step #1 this is a method.  you can create an object with out using the static key world.
        System.out.println("Emmanuel" ); //statement
        System.out.println('U');
        System.out.println("Isidahomen" );
        //var x = new Helloworld(); // This is creating an object using step #2
        //x.Greeting();
    }
     
    
   // public  void Greeting() {  // step #2 this method is created with out the static void and main.
       // System.out.println(" my name is Emmanuel , Thank for asking!!");
